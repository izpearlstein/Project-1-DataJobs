How to navigate the repo: 
- Final notebooks for analysis are in the notebooks directory
- Data CSV files are in the Resources folder
- Saved images of our plots for analysis are in the Images folder

In this repo, we explored the "data" job market in the US. We first pulled relevant, pre-scraped datasets from job boards such as Indeed, Dice, and Monster on Kaggle. We also added Zillow rent and housing prices across the US, along with data from the BLS to compliment our analysis. 

The tools we used to clean and do the analysis include: 
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Gmaps
- Wordcloud

Questions we answered in our project are: 
- What companies are hiring the most "data" jobs?
- What are the different types of "data" roles and what functions do they perform?
- Where are "data" jobs concentrated? 
- What skills are employers looking for in these "data" roles? 
- What kind of salary can be expected for each type of "data" role?
- What areas of the US are "best" for me? Are there "data" job markets in some areas of the US that would allow me to get a good salary but have a low cost of living?
